# POKEDEX

## Project idea
The idea of project is to build a pokedex where user can look up for a specific pokemon.

## API used in the project
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/

## User stories
As a pokemon's fan, I want to search for a pokemon's name and get back pokemon's informations like abilities, types, height and weight.

### MVP Goals
> What is the minimum functionality you commit to meet to pass this project?
The user can search a pokemon's principal informations by typing the pokemon's name or id.
The website has a responsive design adaptable to desktop and mobile and a modal to show up the pokemon that is searched

### Stretch Goals
> If you have time, what additional goals would you like to set for yourself?
I may improve the search option, for example search by type. The user may receive a list of pokemon with the same type.

### Schedule:
First version with most details: January 5th
Second version: January 10th
Deadline: January 17th
